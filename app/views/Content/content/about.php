   <h1>About theUpstairsRoom</h1>
   <p>I'm often asked about the origin of the name theUpstairsRoom. It's pretty
   simple really. When I started doing contract programming work, my office was
   in the loft of our condo. I've spent so much time in that loft,
   it just became known as <em>that upstairs room</em>, as in -
   "your spending so much time in that upstairs room."  Interestingly enough, we
   have since moved out of our condo and into a new home...with my office in the
   downstairs library now...but <em>theDownstairsRoom</em> just doesn't have the
   same ring to it...</p>
   <h1>A little about me</h1>
   <p>I hold degrees in chemistry and in pharmaceutical science from The Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science
    (Since renamed to University of the Sciences in Philadelphia).  My interest in computer programming
     and information technology dates back to my younger days, hacking away in machine code
     on the TI-99/4, TRS-80 and Commodore 64.</p>
   <p>I have worked with companies across the United States in various industries.
    Project types include simple data conversions, data-driven web sites,
    custom desktop applications, and web based collaboration solutions.
    Platforms include both Microsoft technology as well as open source
    technology including the typical LAMP stack (although these days I'm more
    likely to utilize Lighttpd in place of Apache).</p>
   <p>Most recently, I have been focusing my development energies on the
     <a href="http://horde.org">Horde Project</a> where I am a member of the
     <a href="http://horde.org/about/team/">core development team</a>. I'm
     currently busy with putting the finishing touches on a 1.0 release of
     <a href="http://horde.org/ansel">Ansel</a>, developing an iPhoto and an
     Aperture plugin for exporting to Ansel, and I'm also working with the team
     developing an Ajax calendar for <a href="sapo.pt">SAPO</a>, and various
     other tid bits here and there.</p>

   <p>When I'm not behind my laptop or computer screen working, you
      can usually find me at the
      <a href="http://flyingwairport.com" target="__blank">airport</a>
      (or even better, somewhere above one) - satisfying what some call
      an unhealthy obsession for aviation and being airborne in a Cessna 172.
      You can see some pictures

      here</a>. I could also be found trampling through the woods,
      scratching my black and white photography itch. If this is your thing too,
      you can find my gallery
      <a href="http://www.rubinskygallery.com" target="__blank">here.</a>  I
      live in southern New Jersey with my <a href="http://rubinskyfamily.com">wife, daughter and pain-in-the-butt
      feline.</a></p>
